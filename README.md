# Python_project
This is python project where I have built a BMI calculator with python. This BMI calculator can calculate your body mass index. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. I took the BMI categories info from the 'https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov' website and created a calculator on Jupyter Notebook.
